# Best Practices

## Security
- Keep roles minimal; grant admin only when necessary.
- Do not store secrets in code; use env vars.

## Collaboration
- Use comments for targeted feedback; resolve when addressed.
- Create concise versions with clear change summaries.

## Training
- Modularize content; keep lessons short and focused.
- Use assessments to reinforce learning; certify upon passing.

## Exporting
- Prefer exporting Markdown/HTML and saving to PDF via browser.
- For DOCX, integrate a server-side library in production.
